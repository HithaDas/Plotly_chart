# Plotly_chart
Belly Button BioDiversity

# Overview
In this module challenge, we will use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web.
In this challenge, we have a completed panel for demographic information and now need to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, our volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.
